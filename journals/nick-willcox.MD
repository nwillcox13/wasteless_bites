Since we were put in groups, most of our work has been conceptual and non-coding so far. We've gotten our app to a conceptual point where we are happy with the functionality we have planned, as well as the structure, which is generally agreed upon with a few small details left to nail down (allowing for room for error and things that come up as we work). The team is working well in terms of communicating, planning, allowing everyone a chance to speak their opinions, etc. and we are all optimistic that the group will be functioning well throughout the project.

We are expecting to begin the starting rounds of coding during this week. We are hoping to get our databases spun up and our end goal for the week is to have our login/logout/create user functionality under full steam. I think we are anxious to take the first step as a group but the deadline looms, so we are trying out a few "beginning steps" today so we can get the ball rolling. Sorting out and defining different aspects of the project is the final transitional step.

## 17 MAY 2023

We worked as a group on cleaning up the YAML and setting up the database. We spent the rest of the afternoon working on auth. It was slow-going troubleshooting and bug-fixing but we are getting close to functionality and will either finish tonight before we wrap or first thing tomorrow. Overall good day for the group, definitely learning how to groupcode and felt like we made good progress.

We worked on the item form today. River drove and we all took turns navigating. Nothing too crazy, just building up the form and troubleshooting. Morale is still pretty high and everyone is settling in with the dynamic, and we discussed that we felt like we were moving at an acceptable pace and are able to adjust accordingly if we feel we are running behind. Our stated goal is to have MVP done 1 week prior to deadline for stretch goals at the moment.

Harim had a docker issue right of the bat so River showed us some things he had been working on in the meantime. I drove for a while while we finished up the ItemList and ItemDetail views. After break and final attendance, Chris and I had some time to fix up a dropdown and checkbox system on the ItemForm.

## 24 MAY 2023

Today was 'split off and work on small things' day. I was able to add the get all accounts to the backend UI and begin showing ItemList and ItemDetail specific to a logged-in user (still incomplete). Everyone is currently plugging away at their own chores and we plan on circling back and plugging things in together once we've all gotten as far as we can go.

## 25 MAY 2023

Paired programming again, River and I worked on the login handleSubmit and then cleaned up and refactored some existing code as well as put some effort in on the front end while Chris and Harim continued to work out the auth. We spent a lot of time pushing and pulling from git to get us all on the same page and also took a step back to discuss the roadmap for our remaining time before the due date. Everyone is happy with the pace so far and think we will be in a good spot to implement more intricate styling and strectch goals without sweating the deadline too much.

## 26 MAY 2023

Worked with River on styling and CSS, spent some time cleaning up formatting as well while Chris and Harim continued to work the auth. We worked up a few logos and decided on one to throw onto the page. Spent some time pursuing other logo/favicon functionality but it ended up being a wash so we stuck with the original concept.

## 30 MAY 2023

Did lots of small functionality today. Fixed some redirects, cleaned up nav.js tags, created a success message, worked on button functionality and styling. Eternally cleaning up behind myself in the code. Spent some time doing the git flow dance with the group to get everyone back up to date with each others' changes.

## 31 MAY 2023

Made user email a unique field to prevent duplicates, updated the item list and detail styling and some other CSS, fixed the spacing on dietary_restriction again. Itching to get more into back-end functionality at this point but Auth has a lot of that tied up right now so I am waiting for that to be completely done.

## 1 JUN 2023

API implementation day: using pexels and openweather (not ideal in terms of learning new APIs but they provide the functionality we need at the moment) for stock image generation and geolocation functionality respectively. Touched on some styling that I hadn't finished yesterday.

## 2 JUN 2023

Spent the day utilizing the openweather API calls to work on a distance function. Felt funny to spend a whole day on one small line of text on the app but solving the 'puzzle' of it all has been fun so far. Not completed yet and some bugs to work out but should not take too long to finish off.

## 5 JUN 2023

Nav (distance) fixed and implemented! Got to use variable earthRadius in the code, which I thought was funny. We had been sweating deployment all weekend and we were finally able to dig in and begin on it. From what we've gathered, there are still some bugs to work out in the company-side deployment so we are going slowly and meticulously on what we are able to work on.

## 6 JUN 2023

Reading up on deployment to start the day. Full implementation of distance function, then back to working on deployment. Going slow and don't know what I'm doing, but the shape is coming together and the group is all trying to contribute help to it.

## 7 JUN 2023

Got to work with Andrew on our gitlab-ci.yml and get our project to begin building and pipelines functioning. Everyone is polishing off their own preferred aspect of the project so that we can finish deployment as a team. Starting to check off boxes as we get closer to submission deadline and I put some effort in on formatting/indentation as well as getting the readme.md spun up.

## 8 JUN 2023

Worked on deployment all morning. Finally got green checks on all pipelines after much effort and sadness.
