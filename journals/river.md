For the last week and a half, my group and I have been working effectively
on our project. We started by discussing the application and then proceeded to
wire-frame our desired layout. After completing the wire-framing, we individually
researched and evaluated different databases for our project. Ultimately,
we decided to use PostgreSQL as it met our requirements.

Yesterday, we focused on setting up the PostgreSQL database and today we are
dedicated to figuring out JWT authentication and configuring our databases.

It has been a productive period, and we have made significant progress
in fleshing out our idea, completing the necessary frameworks,
and deciding on the appropriate technologies for our project.

## 5-17-2023
Spent most of today working through the remainder of our .yaml file.
Then after we were able to get that worked out
we spent the rest of our day working on authentication with user login and logout.
Also worked on the accounts setup.
So far we have been fully working as a group, having one driver and
the others observing and helping.

## 5-22-2023
Today I drove and made a form using react and JSX spent a lot of the day
going over how we each did our last project in a different way
I also started a List All Items page.


## 5-23-2023
Today we went over the things we had gone over yesterday,
debugged a little bit, but one of us was having technical difficulties,
so i decided to take the time to condense some of the code and apply some CSS and BootStrap
may have decided upon a general theme for the website and possibly a Favicon

## 5-24-23
Today was a very long lecture day. We didn't get any time to work together this morning but
managed to get some good work done in the afternoon. Today we split up the tasks
I went through and re-organized a lot of the code, worked on the front-end main-page'
I also made sure all the forms were working which I ran into an issue with the create account

## 5-30-2023
Today we had a bunch of things to work through with authentication, we also made sure to re-do our
splash page with a faux-table with faux-data. I fully did this solo.

## 5-31-2023
Today I Went through an redid all of the date formats, and worked to get the PEXELS api
working to where i generates a random image based on both the item type and the item name. We then had
to get it into our table on the List Items page

## 6-1-2023
Got the PEXELS API finalized and working and got a lot of thew bugs worked out,
spent most of the day doing this with Nick, and helped Chris with the profile functionality. Also spent a big chunk working on using tailwind. But by the end of the day decided that we would be better off using what was already being used and take a different approach next time

## 6-2-2023
SPent a lot of today working on the table in list items adding and removing what I felt we needed to show up
also spent a good amount of time(too much to be honest) getting the images to show up as the appropriate size.

## 6-5-2023

Worked with Nick all dat getting the NAvigation aspect working with nick, he drove through most of it
I provided A lot of guidance (where i could). We spent most of the day doing lectures so it wasn't the most productive of days.

## 6-6-2023
Spent all of today shifting everything on the nav to be REACT-BOOTSTRAP redid a lot of theming, a lot of it was not difficult but it was intersting to see just how the two different libraries did and didn't interact/

## 6-7-2023
Was a part of getting the gitlab-ci.yml file working, but nick was driving, so I was just following along. After that we all spent a good chunk of time getting random little tasks done and I worked on the READ.me
