For the last week and a half, my group and I have been working effectively
on our project. We started by discussing the application and then proceeded to
wire-frame our desired layout. After completing the wire-framing, we individually
researched and evaluated different databases for our project. Ultimately,
we decided to use PostgreSQL as it met our requirements.

Yesterday, we focused on setting up the PostgreSQL database and today we are
dedicated to figuring out JWT authentication and configuring our databases.

It has been a productive period, and we have made significant progress
in fleshing out our idea, completing the necessary frameworks,
and deciding on the appropriate technologies for our project.

Spent most of today working through the remainder of our .yaml file.
Then after we were able to get that worked out
we spent the rest of our day working on authentication with user login and logout.
Also worked on the accounts setup.
So far we have been fully working as a group, having one driver and
the others observing and helping.

Today I drove and made a form using react and JSX spent a lot of the day
going over how we each did our last project in a different way
I also started a List All Items page.

Today we went over the things we had gone over yesterday,
debugged a little bit, but one of us was having technical difficulties,
so i decided to take the time to condense some of the code and apply some CSS and BootStrap
may have decided upon a general theme for the website and possibly a Favicon
