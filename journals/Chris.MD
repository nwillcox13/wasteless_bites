Up to this point we completed our wireframes with our corresponding
Api design endpoints. Our group has chosen to use PostgreSQL for our
database. A preliminary Docker.yml and docker.dev is complete, we just
need to check the yml and make sure everything is labeled correctly but is
currently functioning. Today we will be working on setting up our database
connecting and creating sign up, login, and logout api endpoints, with
authentication.
